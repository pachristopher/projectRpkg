Description: Creates vector of mortality rates for a heterogeneous population from a Gompertz model. It uses the formulae in Avraam et al, "A mathematical model of mortality dynamics across the lifespan combining heterogeneity and stochastic effects" (2013), p. 803. 
    The inputs to the function are: 'rho0': a vector of initial population proportions;
    m0: a vector of initial mortality rates; beta: a vector of ageing rates;
    age_vec: a vector of ages from 0 to the upper age limit of the population.
    rho0, m0 and beta are all of length of the number of sub-populations.
